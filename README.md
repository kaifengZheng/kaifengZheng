## Hi there 👋

<!--
**kaifengZheng/kaifengZheng** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on using machine-learning models to decode X-ray absorption spectroscopy to seek an understanding of the morphology of nanoparticles and the structure of molten salts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamental physics behind XAS, machine learning algorithms(neural network architectures), mathematical programming(global optimization, such as genetic algorithm, Metropolis Monte Carlo) and advanced python programming and computer algorithms.
