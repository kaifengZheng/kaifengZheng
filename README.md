## Hi there 👋

<!--
**kaifengZheng/kaifengZheng** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on utilizing machine-learning models to decode X-ray absorption spectroscopy, aiming to elucidate the morphology of nanoparticles and the structure of molten salts. 
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in the fundamental physics behind XAS, neural network architectures, global optimization techniques (such as genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing), advanced Python programming, computer algorithms, and chemical visualization tools like Blender, Vista, and Matplotlib.
