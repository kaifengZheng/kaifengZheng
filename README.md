## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kaifengZheng/kaifengZheng** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine-learning models to decode X-ray absorption spectroscopy, aiming to understand the morphological and structural information of nanomaterials. 
- ðŸŒ± To achieve this goal, Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge in the fundamental physics behind XAS, neural network architectures, global optimization techniques (such as genetic algorithm and simulated annealing), advanced Python programming, computer algorithms, and chemical visualization tools like Blender, Vista, and Matplotlib.
