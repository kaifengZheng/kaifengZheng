## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kaifengZheng/kaifengZheng** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using machine-learning models to decode X-ray absorption spectroscopy to seek an understanding of the morphology of nanoparticles and the structure of molten salts. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamental physics behind XAS, machine learning algorithms(neural network architectures), mathematical programming(global optimization, such as genetic algorithm, simulated annealing), advanced python programming, computer algorithms, and chemical visualization tools(Blender, Vista, matplotlib)
